    <center><h1>There's This Boy</h1></center>
    
    <center><p>There's This Boy,</p></center>
  
    <center><p>Standing A High 6 Foot 5,</p></center>
  
    <center><p>There's This Boy,</p></center>
  
    <center><p>Skin So Chocolate And Smooth,</p></center>
  
    <center><p>There's This Boy,</p></center>
  
    <center><p>That Holds My Face And Tells Me I'm Beautiful,</p></center>
  
    <center><p>There's This Boy,</p></center>
  
    <center><p>Who Spoils Me Rotten With The Victoria Secret, Bath And Body Works,</p></center>
    
    <center><p>There's This Boy,</p></center>
  
    <center><p>Who Told Me He Got Me,</p></center>
    
    <center><p>Then Came A Man,</p></center>
  
    <center><p>A Man With So Much Anger Built Inside,</p></center>
    
    <center><p>So Much Hate,</p></center>
  
    <center><p>Until A Bruise Appeared On My Face,</p></center>
    
    <center><p>Until He Released His Hands From My Neck,</p></center>
    
    <center><p>There's This Boy,</p></center>
   
    <center><p>Who Hasn't Bruised Me Since A Year Ago,</p></center>
   
    <center><p>There's This Boy,</p></center>
   
    <center><p>Who I Now Have A Son By, With His Same Smooth Chocolate Skin,</p></center>
   
    <center><p>Whose Family Is Excited About The Aile I'm About To Walk Down,</p></center>
   
    <center><p>There's This Boy,</p></center>
    
    <center><p>That Made Me Look At Him Different,</p></center>
    
    <center><p>There's This Boy,</p></center>
    
    <center><p>Who No Matter What, I Still Loved,</p></center>
    
    <center><p>There's This Boy,</p></center>
    
    <center><p>Who I Will Love From Death Do Us Part,</p></center>
    
    <center><p>Will I Ever Forgive Him?</p></center>
